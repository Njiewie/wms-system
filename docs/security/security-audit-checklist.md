## 🛡️ REMAINING SECURITY TASKS

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Complete these first)

#### Files Still Requiring Security Updates:

1. **outbound_delete.php** - CRITICAL
   ```php
   // CURRENT VULNERABILITY:
   $delete = $conn->query("DELETE FROM outbound_orders WHERE id = $id");

   // REQUIRED FIX:
   secure_delete($conn, 'outbound_orders', 'id = ?', 'i', [$id]);
   ```

2. **outbound_edit.php** - HIGH RISK
   ```php
   // Multiple unvalidated $_POST usage needs fixing
   ```

3. **pick_order.php & ship_order.php** - HIGH RISK
   ```php
   // Direct SQL queries need prepared statements
   ```

4. **auto_release_orders.php** - MEDIUM RISK
   ```php
   // Automated processes need extra security
   ```

5. **fetch_sku_info.php** - MEDIUM RISK
   ```php
   // AJAX endpoint needs CSRF protection
   ```

  ```sql
  SELECT user_id, action, COUNT(*) as frequency
  FROM audit_log
  WHERE timestamp > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
